# Logo Notes

To recreate the Redox OS logo, please be aware of the following:
- The font is Evolventa.
- The "R" is font size 160, normal weight.
- The "R" is slightly to the right of center relative to the orbitals, to improve visual balance.
- The "edox" is font size 135. The weight is manually increased to match the line thickness of the "R".
- The kerning (letter spacing) on the "edox" is about -2px.
- The "OS" is font size 125. The weight is manually increased to match the line thickness of the other letters.

- The "R in orbitals" logo is the same "R" as in the main logo, but moved slightly more to the right than in the full logo to further improve visual balance.
